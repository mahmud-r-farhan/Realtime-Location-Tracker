## FAQ

**Q: How accurate is the GPS?**
A: Depends on device hardware (typically ±5-50 meters).

**Q: Can I use custom map providers?**
A: Yes! Use the new Layer Control to switch between default maps, or edit `map.js` to add more.

**Q: Is the SOS feature secure?**
A: SOS alerts are broadcast to all connected users only. Data is sanitized server-side.

**Q: Does the app work offline?**
A: Yes! The PWA caches assets and shows an offline page when connectivity is lost.

## Troubleshooting

- **Location Not Updating:** Ensure geolocation is enabled and the browser has permission
- **WebSocket Errors:** Verify port 3007 is open and not blocked by a firewall
- **SOS Not Working:** Check browser notification permissions and microphone access
- **PWA Not Installing:** Ensure you're accessing via HTTPS or localhost
- **WebRTC Issues:** Check STUN/TURN server configurations and network connectivity
